# Todo-App

The ToDo web application is a simple browser based ToDo list, built with vanilla JavaScript, html5 and css3. It uses a Model View Controller (MVC) structure and was developed using a Test Driven Devlopment (TDD) approach (with the jasmine framework). The appication allows a user to add a new todo, edit or delete an existing todo, or select all todos at once and then delete them if desired. The user can also view completed or incompleted ToDos.
