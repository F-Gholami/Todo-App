# Todo-App

The ToDo web application is a simple browser-based ToDo list, built with vanilla JavaScript, html5, and css3. It uses a **Model View Controller** (MVC) structure and was developed using a **Test Driven Development** (TDD) approach (Jasmine framework).

The application allows a user to add a new todo, edit or delete an existing todo, or select all todos at once and then delete them if desired. The user can also view completed or incompleted ToDos.
